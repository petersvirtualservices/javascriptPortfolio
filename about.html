        <p>Everyone can have a positive cumulation of moments if their mind codes for it. With a certificate in
            Full-Stack Web Development that focuses on Javascript, React, and NodeJs from Kansas University and a
            Bachelors of Arts in Psychology from Wichita State University, I believe that I can help those who cannot
            see that moment within themselves by creating virtual-reality simulations to improve their social skills to
            take advantage of those moments.</p>

        <p>My business, Peters Virtual Services, started with small customer-audit jobs, and has grown to become a
            Top-Rated-Plus account on Upwork. That result is because I have had great clients and they have had reason
            to trust me with their work. I want to help others find a similar path. Quite honestly, I understand that
            the mind is a very complex puzzle, but if I can put 5 pieces of a 1000-piece puzzle together, have I not
            made a contribution?</p>

        <p>Thank you for visiting my page!</p>
