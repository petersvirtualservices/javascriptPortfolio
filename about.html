    <p>Everyone can have a positive cumulation of moments if their mind codes for it. With a certificate in Full-Stack Web Development that focuses on Javascript, React, and NodeJs from Kansas University and a Bachelors of Arts in Psychology from Wichita State University, I believe that I can help those who cannot see that moment within themselves by creating virtual-reality simulations to improve their social skills to take advantage of those moments.</p>

    <p>My business, Peters Virtual Services, started with small customer-audit jobs, and has grown to become a Top-Rated-Plus account on Upwork. That result is because I have had great clients and they have had reason to trust me with their work. I want to help others find a similar path. Quite honestly, I understand that the mind is a very complex puzzle, but if I can put 5 pieces of a 1000-piece puzzle together, have I not made a contribution?</p>

    <p>Thank you for visiting my page!</p>
